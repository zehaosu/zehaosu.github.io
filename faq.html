		<span class="text-background">Why do we care about causal inference?</span><br>
		The famous phrase "correlation does not imply causation" already warns you about the great danger of assuming cause-effect relationship from association in statistical analysis with observational data. How can we make (possibly) solid statements about causality without having to conduct a randomised controlled trial? How can we teach out models to "think" like us human? This usually requires domain knowledge. See also a good metaphor called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model#Ladder_of_causation">Ladder of Causation</a> from Judea Pearl.
