				<p><u>Are the questions on this page really "frequently asked"?

				<p>The answer is no.</p>

				<p><u>Why are you writing this page?</u></p>
				<p>To be completely honest, I don't really know. Maybe it will come in handy in the future.</p>

				<p><u>Why do we care about causal inference?</u></p>
				<p>The famous phrase "correlation does not imply causation" already warns you about the great danger of assuming cause-effect relationship from association in statistical analysis with observational data. How can we make (possibly) solid statements about causality without having to conduct a randomised controlled trial? How can we teach our models to "think" like us human? This usually requires domain knowledge. See also a good metaphor coined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model#Ladder_of_causation">Ladder of Causation</a> from Judea Pearl.</p>
